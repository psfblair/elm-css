# Klee: CSS in Elm

This project supplies a type-safe domain-specific language for creating CSS
stylesheets in the Elm language. The library is based on Sebastiaan Visser's 
Haskell Clay CSS library (http://fvisser.nl/clay/), though it has diverged to
a fairly large extent. 

"Klee" is pronounced the same as "clay," after the surname of the Swiss-German
painter and design theorist Paul Klee.

Documentation is currently a work in progress, but the tests provide pretty good
examples of how to use practically everything.
