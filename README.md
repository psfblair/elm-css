# CSS in Elm

This project supplies a type-safe domain-specific language for creating CSS
stylesheets in the Elm language. The library is based on the Haskell Clay
CSS library (http://fvisser.nl/clay/), though some of the operators have been
changed.

Documentation is currently a work in progress, but the source code is
extensively commented.
